# Elite Scholar - School Management System

## Overview

Elite Scholar is a comprehensive School Management System MVP built as a full-stack web application. The platform provides invoice management, payment tracking, school administration, and feature management capabilities for educational institutions. The system supports multiple school types (K12 and Nigerian curriculum) with role-based access control spanning from super administrators to individual students and parents.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The client-side is built using **Vite + React + TypeScript** with a component-based architecture:

- **UI Framework**: React with TypeScript for type safety
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with shadcn/ui component library for consistent design
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing with role-based route protection
- **State Management**: 
  - Zustand for local UI state (auth store)
  - React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management and caching
- **Code Splitting**: React.lazy + Suspense for route-level code splitting
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
The server-side follows a **Node.js + Express + TypeScript** REST API pattern:

- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **File Uploads**: Multer with Cloudinary integration for image storage
- **Email Service**: Nodemailer for transactional emails
- **Middleware**: Custom auth, feature toggle, and payment verification middleware

### Database Design
PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM featuring:

- **User Management**: Multi-role user system (superadmin, school_admin, branch_admin, teacher, student, parent)
- **School Structure**: Schools with branches, grade sections with section references based on curriculum type
- **Automatic Grade Section Creation**: When schools are created, grade sections are automatically generated with section IDs
- **Feature System**: Modular features with per-school toggles
- **Invoice System**: Complete invoicing with line items, unit measurements, and negotiated pricing
- **Subscription Management**: School payment status and access control

### Authentication & Authorization
JWT-based authentication system with:

- **Role-based Access Control**: Six distinct user roles with hierarchical permissions
- **School Association**: Users tied to specific schools/branches for data isolation
- **Feature Toggles**: Per-school feature enablement stored in database
- **Payment Verification**: Middleware to block access for unpaid schools

### Modular Architecture
The system is designed with independent modules:

- **Super Admin Module**: School management, invoice creation, feature toggles
- **Invoice Module**: Enhanced invoice generation with unit measurements, negotiated pricing, payment tracking, email notifications
- **Grade Management**: Automatic grade section creation with section IDs for proper student organization
- **Auth Module**: User authentication, role management, password policies
- Each module has dedicated routes, database models, and frontend components

### Recent Enhancements (August 2025)
