Correction — Grade Groups, Branch Management, Features, and Soft Deletes
1. Grade Groups in School Creation
In the School Creation form:

Instead of listing individual grades directly, display grade groups (e.g., Nursery, Primary, Secondary, Islamiyya, Adult Learning).

When a group is selected, the system should automatically link all grades under that group to the school (even though they are not shown individually).

Examples:

K12 Curriculum: Nursery, Primary, Secondary.

Nigerian Curriculum: Nursery, Primary, Secondary, Islamiyya, Adult Learning.

For Islamiyya and Adult Learning, each group has 6 classes that should be created automatically when the group is selected.

This must work for both K12 and Nigerian Curriculum schools.

2. Branch Management in Schools Component
Add a Manage Branches action in the Schools list.

In Branch Management:

Add Branch

Edit Branch

Suspend Branch (status = suspended)

Delete Branch → Soft delete by setting status = deleted (do not remove from DB).

Any branch with status = deleted must not appear in the frontend.

3. Feature Management in Schools
In Manage Features for a school:

Display all features from the Features page.

Each feature has a toggle:

If toggled ON, add the feature to the school.

If toggled OFF, remove the feature from the school.

Ensure this updates the database immediately and works for both creation and editing of schools.

4. Soft Delete for Schools
When deleting a school:

Set status = deleted (do not remove from DB).

Any school with status = deleted must not appear in the frontend.

5. Edit School
The Edit School action should open the same form as School Creation.

The form must:

Pre-fill with the school’s existing data.

Allow editing of all fields.

Allow toggling of features ON/OFF.

Allow toggling of grade groups.

On save, update all changes in the database correctly.

✅ Key Points to Enforce:

All soft deletes (status = deleted) are hidden from the frontend.

Grade group selection auto-adds the correct grades and classes.

Branch management supports add, edit, suspend, and soft delete.

Feature toggles work instantly for schools.

Edit school uses the same component as create school.
