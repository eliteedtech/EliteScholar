Step-by-Step Implementation Plan — Grade Groups, Branch Management, Features, and Soft Deletes
Step 1 — Grade Groups in School Creation
In the School Creation form, replace the individual grade checkboxes with grade group checkboxes.
Example group names:

K12 Curriculum: Nursery, Primary, Secondary.

Nigerian Curriculum: Nursery, Primary, Secondary, Islamiyya, Adult Learning.

When a group is selected, the system should automatically:

Link all grades under that group to the school (these grades are not shown individually in the UI).

Create the correct number of classes for that group.

Special case:

Islamiyya and Adult Learning groups must always have 6 classes created automatically when selected.

This logic must work for both K12 and Nigerian Curriculum schools.

Step 2 — Branch Management in Schools Component
In the Schools list component, add an "Manage Branches" action for each school.

Branch management should allow:

Add Branch

Edit Branch

Suspend Branch → change status = suspended

Delete Branch → soft delete by setting status = deleted (do not remove from DB).

Ensure any branch with status = deleted is not displayed on the frontend.

Step 3 — Manage Features for a School
In the Manage Features section for a school:

Display all available features from the Features page.

Each feature has an ON/OFF toggle:

If toggled ON, add that feature to the school in the DB.

If toggled OFF, remove it from the school in the DB.

This must work both in School Creation and Edit School.

Step 4 — Soft Delete for Schools
When a school is deleted:

Change its status to deleted in the database.

Do not remove the record.

Any school with status = deleted must not appear anywhere in the frontend.

Step 5 — Edit School
The Edit School action must open the same form used for creating schools.

The form should:

Pre-fill with the school’s existing data.

Allow changing any field.

Allow toggling grade groups ON/OFF.

Allow toggling features ON/OFF.

On save:

Update all school data in the DB.

Update related grade group assignments.

Update features assigned to the school.

✅ Key Rules to Follow:

All deletes for schools and branches must be soft deletes (status = deleted).

Grade group selection should automatically add all grades and classes without showing them individually.

Islamiyya and Adult Learning must always have 6 classes.

Branch and feature management must update immediately in the DB and reflect instantly on the frontend.
